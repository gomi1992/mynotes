[空速计算公式](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indicated_airspeed)
```c
 // https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indicated_airspeed
            // Indicated airspeed (IAS) is the airspeed read directly from the airspeed indicator on an aircraft, driven by the pitot-static system.
            // The IAS is an important value for the pilot because it is the indicated speeds which are specified in the aircraft flight manual for
            // such important performance values as the stall speed. A typical aircraft will always stall at the same indicated airspeed (for the current configuration)
            // regardless of density, altitude or true airspeed.
            //
            // Therefore we shouldn't care about CAS/TAS and only calculate IAS since it's more indicative to the pilot and more useful in calculations
            // It also allows us to use pitot_scale to calibrate the dynamic pressure sensor scale
            pitot.airSpeed = pitotmeterConfig()->pitot_scale * sqrtf(2.0f * fabsf(pitot.pressure - pitot.pressureZero) / AIR_DENSITY_SEA_LEVEL_15C) * 100;
